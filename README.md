Ep 299:  
-naruto bee and itachi fought with a full powered naguto who waz able to incapacitate both naruto and bee but was helped by itachi  
-itachi being itachi Al ays looks for weakness in a jutsu when planatory devastration was used itachi figure out that the center draws everything so he suggest to attack with their strongest jutsu and it will just draw to center to destroy the gravitational core  
-and nagoto got impaled by itachi blade and got sealed how was nagato not detect the balde coming i cannot understand even with renagan kabuto suggest its because naguto movement was sloopy dosent seems to me ilit would had been better if insteadof smoke it threw rumbles and then naguto got impaled.
-still naruto was stubborn about ending the qar by himself and itachi has a good point that just because naruto got power now he should not cast other who want to help aside and take the responsibility himself tge village people only view him as hero cause them see him like them now and naruto understands them  if naruto continues to take all responsibility alone he will end up like madara   
-itachi suggest that he has the best chance of releasing the reanimation jutsu and naruto must focus on fighting madara   
-itachi also shows growth that he was wrong for handling sasuka alone and entrust naruto who has the same personality as sisui he has better chance at persayuing sasuka 
-i still dont understand being a battle genius why doesnt naruto leave a clone or two to atleaat use sage mode to absorbe chakra to keep his chakra all time high so that when kura is drawing naruto chakra when naruto uses kaurama his own chakra wont get low and die 

Ep 300:  
-oniki fight 1st mistukage and was unable to see him due to his camouflage jitsu so use stone clone to increase the number

-gara joining with oniki was able to find the 1st miatukage but they weren too slow and naruto even with surprise attack 1st was able to detect that but quick thinking gara with gara they were able to land a rasengane full rotation to knock 1st to ground and oniki use stone bolder to stop his movement and seal him 
-gara and oniki join the 2nd mistukage fight and gara was distracted while usig his sand to find the clamp and was on defence to save from 2nd bubble attack  upoj finding the clamp oniki was out of juice but uses earth bolder to make stone fist heavier but got handicap with bavk pain abd got hit by water gun of mistukage 

Ep 301:  
-Raikaga become too fast for solider to catch him but being too dureable he was not captured  
-naruto hit him but constantly catching the rasensuriken when raikaga dodge it and it seems kabuto keep getting better at handling reanimation when their emotion is switch off.  
-raikage start using his no of finger jutsu where every less finger he use his speed keep getting faster  
-but naruto figure it that raikage can only be damaged by his own spear so  naruto dodge raikage attack and use sage mode for faster dection of raikage attack and react faster and  uses rasengen on raikage hand to redirect his spear attack to himself and damaged itself enough fot the sealing team to work  
naruto started to show his battle observation and battle genius

Ep 302:  
-gara was able to switch oniki with a sand clone when oniki broke his back when destroying the gaint clam  
-failed to seal 2nd misukage even with gaint sand coffin as misukage started using hiw explosion clone jutsu which store oil inside it and started expanding more it move and create a bomb  
-gara was able to mix gold with sand and heat the sand when the clone attack and was able it make it absorbe the gold to make the clone movement slugish and heat the sand to turn the clone mist into a gold statue like glass and was able to seal the mistukage with more sand coffin  
-but 1st mistukage was able to make a clone of himself  and escape the sealing when naruto attack with final rotation jutsu when it hit 1st  
-while the problem with not able to identify friend to foes cause of white zetsu is not solved and the seven swordman of the mist is still not sealed totally  

Ep 303:  
-only the ino-sika-cho was able to win the fight against their enemy,the medical team cannot take any more injures,kakashi,guy,sai,rock lee still fighting the seven swordman of the mist,neji,hinata kiba still fight amount themselves,samurai fight against the bone shibone and granny and madara joining with the jinchuriki pains

-kabuto summon real madara   
-naruto join every battle and assist with white zetsu problem   
-the famous madara beatdown   
-i guess naruto is still dumb that he cannot use his shadow to use sage mode to replenish this chakra   
-it was wrong to use water style against fire style madara as it create steam and madara uses this steam as smoke screen and use more fire style to attack   
-always love the use of earth style mobile core to move the target to catch them offguard and naruto uses massive rasengan to hit madara but susanu protects madara   
-so i was wrong about naruto not using sage mode he used it but it takes time but still using a clone to replenish chakra was a good idea but the clone has to be released to gain the chakra so it seem a bit drawback  
-madara was able to awakane rinnagan and counter rasengan surikan   
-madara summon the planatery bolder and everybody loss hope and onoki try to make the bolder lighter with assist of gara sand to stop the bolder with giving everything even over his own limit but the second bolder comes and they all fall with heavy injury    

Ep 323:  
-kuruma finally decided to share his chakra with naruto and use rasengan barage to counter deep wood rather than rasensuriken  
-oniki was able to learn that just fighting amoung them not only create more pain and they grew farther away form peace  but thats why oniki was able to have the will to fight madara even with highly injure  
-black zetsu was defeated cause of choziro has absorbe chakra to make blade bigger  
-raikaga and tsunada along with 4th mistukage join the batttle with 5 kage fighting side by side  
-madara can now use wood style   
-5 kage cordination was good enough to break the madara susanu
